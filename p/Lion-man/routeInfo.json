It has been determined by carbon dating of the layer in which it was found to be between 35,000 and 40,000 years old, and therefore is associated with the archaeological Aurignacian culture of the Upper Paleolithic. It was carved out of mammoth ivory using a flint stone knife. Seven parallel, transverse, carved gouges are on the left arm.","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Loewenmensch1.jpg/480px-Loewenmensch1.jpg","position":{"left":"33%"}},"content":"The lion-headed figurine is the oldest-known zoomorphic (animal-shaped) sculpture in the world, and the oldest-known uncontested example of figurative art.
