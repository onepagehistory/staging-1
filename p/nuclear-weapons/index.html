Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BCE, he travelled to Croton, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included vegetarianism, although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":25140,"y":8},"yearPosition":{"width":750,"height":16,"x":25140,"y":0}},{"title":"Leonardo da Vinci","subtitle":"15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519","from":1452,"to":1519,"short":"Italian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour_%28cropped%29.jpg/440px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour_%28cropped%29.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci","name":"leonardo-da-vinci","content":"\n\n\nItalian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":5000,"y":116},"yearPosition":{"width":670,"height":16,"x":5000,"y":108}},{"title":"Caesar","subtitle":"12 or 13 July 100 BCE – 15 March 44 BCE","from":-100,"to":-44,"short":"Roman politician, military general, and historian who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Retrato_de_Julio_C%C3%A9sar_%2826724093101%29.jpg/440px-Retrato_de_Julio_C%C3%A9sar_%2826724093101%29.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar","name":"caesar","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":20630,"y":8},"yearPosition":{"width":560,"height":16,"x":20630,"y":0}},{"title":"William Shakespeare","subtitle":"bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616","from":1564,"to":1616,"short":"English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Shakespeare.jpg/375px-Shakespeare.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare","name":"william-shakespeare","content":"\n\n\nEnglish poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":4030,"y":8},"yearPosition":{"width":520,"height":16,"x":4030,"y":0}},{"title":"Napoléon Bonaparte","subtitle":"15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821","from":1769,"to":1821,"short":"French statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/288px-Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon","name":"napoleon","content":"\n\n\nFrench statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":1980,"y":26},"yearPosition":{"width":520,"height":16,"x":1980,"y":18}},{"title":"Alexander the Great","subtitle":"20/21 July 356 BCE – 10/11 June 323 BCE","from":-356,"to":-323,"short":"A king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty.
