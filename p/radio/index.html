Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BCE, he travelled to Croton, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle.

It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4,355,725 residents, thus making it the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. The Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":27720,"y":8},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":27720,"y":0}},{"title":"Scientific Revolution","subtitle":"~ 1543","from":1543,"to":1543,"short":"The Scientific Revolution was a series of events that marked the emergence of modern science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg/520px-CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution","name":"scientific-revolution","content":"\n\n\nThe Scientific Revolution was a series of events that marked the emergence of modern science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":4760,"y":8},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":4760,"y":0}},{"title":"Babylon","subtitle":"1895 BCE","from":-1895,"to":-1895,"short":"Babylon was a key kingdom in ancient Mesopotamia from the 18th to 6th centuries BCE.","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/US_Navy_030529-N-5362A-001_A_U.S._Marine_Corps_Humvee_vehicle_drives_down_a_road_at_the_foot_of_Saddam_Hussein%27s_former_Summer_palace_with_ruins_of_ancient_Babylon_in_the_background.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon","name":"babylon","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":39140,"y":8},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":39140,"y":0}},{"title":"Steam engine","subtitle":"1712","from":1712,"to":1712,"short":"","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/JamesWattEngine.jpg/640px-JamesWattEngine.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine","name":"steam-engine","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":3070,"y":90},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":3070,"y":82}},{"title":"Steam locomotive","subtitle":"1802","from":1802,"to":1802,"short":"","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/California_Western_Railroad_Locomotive_45.jpg/440px-California_Western_Railroad_Locomotive_45.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive","name":"steam-locomotive","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":2170,"y":90},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":2170,"y":82}},{"title":"Troy","subtitle":"3000 BCE - 500 CE","from":-3000,"to":-3000,"short":"Troy was a city in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor, now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, just south of the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles strait and northwest of Mount Ida.","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Ruinen_von_Troja_Karlsruher_Unterhaltungsblatt_1835.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy","name":"troy","content":"\n\n\n\"Troy was a city in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor, now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, just south of the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles strait and northwest of Mount Ida. The present-day location is known as Hisarlik. It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle, in particular in the Iliad, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name Ἴλιον (Ilion) formerly began with a digamma: Ϝίλιον (Wilion); this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city, Wilusa. A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople, became a bishopric and declined gradually in the Byzantine era, but is now a Latin Catholic titular see.\"","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":50190,"y":8},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":50190,"y":0}},{"title":"USA","subtitle":"July 4, 1776","from":1776,"to":1776,"short":"","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States","name":"united-states","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":2430,"y":44},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":2430,"y":36}},{"title":"First photo","subtitle":"~ 1826","from":1826,"to":1826,"short":"Nicéphore Niépce — French inventor, usually credited as the inventor of photography and a pioneer in that field","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/LEI0440_Leica_IIIf_chrom_-_Sn._580566_1951-52-M39_Blitzsynchron_front_view-6531_hf-.jpg/440px-LEI0440_Leica_IIIf_chrom_-_Sn._580566_1951-52-M39_Blitzsynchron_front_view-6531_hf-.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras","name":"view-from-the-window-at-le-gras","content":"\n\n\nNicéphore Niépce — French inventor, usually credited as the inventor of photography and a pioneer in that field","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":1930,"y":108},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":1930,"y":100}},{"title":"Automobile","subtitle":"1769","from":1769,"to":1769,"short":"First steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Ford_Model_T_and_VW_type_11_Luxus%2C_Technisches_Museum_Wien%2C_Juni_2009.jpg/600px-Ford_Model_T_and_VW_type_11_Luxus%2C_Technisches_Museum_Wien%2C_Juni_2009.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_automobile","name":"automobile","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":2500,"y":134},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":2500,"y":126}},{"title":"Light bulb","subtitle":"Around 1880s","from":1880,"to":1880,"short":"","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Livermore_Centennial_Light_Bulb.jpg/266px-Livermore_Centennial_Light_Bulb.jpg","wikiUrl":"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb","name":"incandescent-light-bulb","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":1390,"y":98},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":1390,"y":90}},{"title":"Radio","subtitle":"around 1890s","from":1890,"to":1890,"short":"","imageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/FFU_trx_Stiff_1904.JPG","wikiUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_radio","name":"radio","content":"\n\n\n","cardPosition":{"width":337,"height":80,"x":1290,"y":180},"yearPosition":{"width":0,"height":16,"x":1290,"y":172}}]}}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/styles.ab1fa52e.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/vendors~src/EventPage/EventPageContainer.11a4bfd4.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/src/EventPage/EventPageContainer.09f45501.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/vendors~main.e021c934.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.d5c9fe8b.js"></script></body></html>
