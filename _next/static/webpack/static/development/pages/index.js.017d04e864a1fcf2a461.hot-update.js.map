His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.'\n          , imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Charles_Robert_Darwin_by_John_Collier.jpg/440px-Charles_Robert_Darwin_by_John_Collier.jpg'\n          , position:\n              { left: '23%'\n              , top: getTopPos(1809)\n              }\n          }\n\n        , { name: 'Leonardo_da_Vinci'\n          , type: HistoryEntryType.Event\n          , title: 'Leonardo da Vinci'\n          , subtitle: '15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519'\n          , shortDescription: 'Italian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography'\n          , imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour_%28cropped%29.jpg/440px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour_%28cropped%29.jpg'\n          , position:\n              { left: '40%'\n              , top: getTopPos(1452)\n              }\n          } \n        ]\n}"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAiBA;AAQA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AARA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AARA;AAaA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AARA;AAaA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AARA;AAaA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AARA;AAaA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AARA;AAaA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AARA;AAaA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AACA;AARA;AAaA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AAYA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAPA;AArTA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
